# Ticket-Sales-Booking-System
This is a program to sale airplane's ticket.
Every user has an account that can do some activities through that.
As a user, you can purchase a ticket or cancel it, change your password, charge your account, see your budget ot delete your account.
As an admin, you can add flights, show flights, and see the company's capital.

I have used OOP for this project, as there are several objects with specific attributes, communicating with each other. Also, I have used Maven build system. 
There are 4 packages in the program. "views" that is relevant to the UI. "models" that have the attributes of our objects. "enums" that contains the key words in commands, so that the program can so the activity that the user wants. "controller" which contains mostly the methods regarding controlling the models. 
Based on the menu we are in, every input get checked with its relevant menu commands. If the input doesnt match any of the menu commands, user gets a "invalid command!" massage. For each input that matches a command, a method is structured to do what the user wants.
